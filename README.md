It is a modular console-based ferry reservation system developed in C++, simulating real-world ferry operations similar to those of BC Ferries. The system enables ferry operators to manage reservations, sailings, vehicles, and vessels through an interactive terminal interface, with all data stored using binary file I/O for persistence. 
The system is built following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), starting from real-time user requirement gathering, progressing through user manuals, architectural and detailed design documents, that went through constant scrutiny and version histories. The program is a fully OOP oriented and is fully functional and testable. All documentation, including design diagrams and a user manual, was maintained and version-controlled throughout development.
It is a project applies key object-oriented programming principles — encapsulation, modularity, and inheritance — using separate modules and header files. We followed Agile development practices, delivering features incrementally and iterating based on planned milestones.
